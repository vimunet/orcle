To prevent a `ConcurrentLinkedQueue` from causing an out-of-memory issue, you need to manage the queue size carefully, as `ConcurrentLinkedQueue` itself is unbounded and does not impose any size limits. Here are some effective strategies to avoid memory overflow:

### 1. **Use a Bounded Queue (Alternative Queue Type)**
   - If possible, switch to a bounded queue, such as `LinkedBlockingQueue`, where you can specify a maximum capacity. This will automatically block producers or throw exceptions when the queue reaches its limit.

   ```java
   import java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue;
   import java.util.concurrent.LinkedBlockingQueue;

   public class BoundedQueueExample {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           BlockingQueue<String> queue = new LinkedBlockingQueue<>(1000); // Set maximum capacity

           // Example usage
           queue.offer("task"); // Adds a task without exceeding memory limits
       }
   }
   ```

### 2. **Limit the Size of `ConcurrentLinkedQueue` with Custom Logic**
   - If you must use `ConcurrentLinkedQueue`, implement a custom mechanism to limit its size. This can be done by monitoring the size of the queue and discarding or delaying new elements if the queue exceeds a certain threshold.

   ```java
   import java.util.Queue;
   import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentLinkedQueue;

   public class LimitedConcurrentQueue<T> {
       private final Queue<T> queue = new ConcurrentLinkedQueue<>();
       private final int maxCapacity;

       public LimitedConcurrentQueue(int maxCapacity) {
           this.maxCapacity = maxCapacity;
       }

       public boolean offer(T item) {
           if (queue.size() < maxCapacity) {
               return queue.offer(item);
           } else {
               System.out.println("Queue is full. Item rejected.");
               return false;
           }
       }

       public T poll() {
           return queue.poll();
       }

       // Additional queue operations can be added here as needed
   }

   // Usage example
   public class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           LimitedConcurrentQueue<String> queue = new LimitedConcurrentQueue<>(1000);
           queue.offer("task"); // Adds task if within limit
       }
   }
   ```

   This approach avoids the queue from growing indefinitely by rejecting new elements when a threshold is reached. However, since `ConcurrentLinkedQueue` does not have built-in capacity limits, this logic needs to be carefully managed to ensure accurate handling of concurrency.

### 3. **Periodically Remove Elements**
   - Use a background thread or scheduled task to periodically remove elements from the queue if it exceeds a certain size. This can prevent long-lived elements from occupying memory indefinitely.

   ```java
   import java.util.Queue;
   import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentLinkedQueue;
   import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
   import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;

   public class QueueCleanupExample {

       private static final Queue<String> queue = new ConcurrentLinkedQueue<>();
       private static final int MAX_CAPACITY = 1000;

       public static void main(String[] args) {
           // Schedule a cleanup task to run periodically
           Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(1).scheduleAtFixedRate(() -> {
               while (queue.size() > MAX_CAPACITY) {
                   queue.poll(); // Remove oldest elements
               }
           }, 1, 1, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

           // Add elements to the queue as needed
           queue.offer("task");
       }
   }
   ```

   This approach helps keep the queue size manageable by regularly discarding old elements.

### 4. **Monitor and Adjust Queue Usage Dynamically**
   - Use monitoring tools (e.g., JMX, or custom metrics) to watch queue size and memory usage at runtime, allowing dynamic tuning. If memory usage approaches a critical threshold, take measures like slowing down producers or clearing the queue.

### 5. **Implement Backpressure on Producers**
   - If your application design allows, implement backpressure by pausing or slowing down producer threads when the queue reaches a certain size. This can prevent overloading the queue with new elements.

These strategies can help you prevent `ConcurrentLinkedQueue` from growing indefinitely and causing out-of-memory issues, ensuring that your application remains within safe memory limits.
