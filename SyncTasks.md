Yes, you're absolutely right! Before creating the CI pipeline in GitLab, you need to set up the necessary repository group and a new repository for the project in GitLab as well. Here's the revised high-level task list that incorporates these steps:

### **Jira Note: High-Level Task List for GitLab Repository, Nexus Repository, GitHub CI, and Harness Pipelines Setup**

**Objective:**
1. Create a repository group and a new repository in GitLab for the new project.
2. Create a repository group and a new repository in Nexus for the new project.
3. Set up a GitHub CI pipeline to build and deploy the mirrored artifact to the Nexus repository.
4. Create Harness pipelines to deploy the artifacts.
5. Modify AWS ECS to support the new deployment.

### **High-Level Task List**

#### **1. Create GitLab Repository Group and New Repository for the Project**

- **Task 1.1**: **Create GitLab Repository Group**
  - Log into GitLab and navigate to the **Groups** section.
  - Create a new repository group (e.g., `project-group`) to organize related projects.

- **Task 1.2**: **Create New GitLab Repository**
  - Within the newly created group, create a new repository for the project (e.g., `project-repo`).
  - Set the appropriate visibility and permissions for the repository.

- **Task 1.3**: **Add Initial Code and Set Up Branches**
  - Push the initial codebase to the new repository.
  - Set up necessary branches (e.g., `master`, `develop`) as needed for the project.

#### **2. Create Nexus Repository Group and New Repository for the Project**

- **Task 2.1**: **Create Nexus Repository Group**
  - Log into Nexus and navigate to the **Repositories** section.
  - Create a new **repository group** (e.g., `project-repo-group`) to aggregate the new repository.

- **Task 2.2**: **Create Nexus Repository for the New Project**
  - Create a **hosted repository** in Nexus for the new project (e.g., `project-artifacts`).
  - Configure the repository to store the project's artifacts (e.g., Maven, npm, Docker).
  - Add the new repository to the repository group created in **Task 2.1**.

- **Task 2.3**: **Configure Repository Permissions**
  - Ensure appropriate permissions are configured for the new repository:
    - Set up user roles and access control to restrict or allow artifact uploads.
    - Ensure deployment credentials are generated or configured.

#### **3. Set Up GitHub CI Pipeline to Build and Deploy to Nexus**

- **Task 3.1**: **Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` GitHub Actions Pipeline**
  - Define a GitHub Actions workflow to trigger on push or pull requests.
  - Steps to include:
    - Check out the mirrored repository from GitLab.
    - Set up the build environment (e.g., install dependencies).
    - Build the project (e.g., package the application, create artifacts).
    - Authenticate and deploy the artifact to the Nexus repository.

- **Task 3.2**: **Configure Nexus Credentials in GitHub Secrets**
  - Add Nexus repository credentials (`NEXUS_USERNAME` and `NEXUS_PASSWORD`) to GitHub Secrets for secure deployment.
  - Ensure the GitHub Actions pipeline can access the Nexus repository using the correct credentials.

- **Task 3.3**: **Test and Verify the Pipeline**
  - Run the GitHub pipeline to ensure the build completes successfully and the artifact is deployed to Nexus.

#### **4. Create Harness Pipelines for Artifact Deployment**

- **Task 4.1**: **Create Harness Pipeline for Staging Environment**
  - Define a Harness pipeline to deploy artifacts from the Nexus repository to the staging environment.
  - Set up environment variables and secrets (from Harness Secret Manager) for the deployment process.

- **Task 4.2**: **Create Harness Pipeline for Production Environment**
  - Define another pipeline for production deployment.
  - Set up approvals and notifications for the production deployment process.

- **Task 4.3**: **Test and Validate Harness Pipelines**
  - Run the staging pipeline to validate artifact deployment in the staging environment.
  - Conduct test deployments for production or a dry run as necessary.

#### **5. Modify AWS ECS to Support New Deployment**

- **Task 5.1**: **Update ECS Task Definitions**
  - Update ECS task definitions to point to the new Docker image (artifact deployed to Nexus via Harness).
  - Adjust any required environment variables to align with the new deployment strategy.

- **Task 5.2**: **Update ECS Service**
  - Modify the ECS service to use the updated task definitions.
  - Ensure ECS is configured to pull Docker images from the Nexus repository.

- **Task 5.3**: **Test ECS Service Updates**
  - Test the ECS service with the updated task definitions and verify successful deployments.
  - Conduct rollback tests to ensure ECS can revert to previous versions in case of failure.

---

### **Additional Considerations:**
- **Security**: Ensure all credentials (Nexus, AWS, GitHub) are securely stored (e.g., GitHub Secrets, Harness Secret Manager).
- **Repository Management**: Document the repository group and structure in GitLab and Nexus for future projects.
- **Monitoring and Alerts**: Set up monitoring for Nexus repository usage, ECS deployments, and Harness pipelines.

This updated high-level task list includes the steps for creating the repository group and new repository in GitLab as a prerequisite for setting up the CI pipeline and deploying via Harness.
