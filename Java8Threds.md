If you want to ensure compatibility with Java 8, there are some minor adjustments to make. While the provided code already works in Java 8, you may consider the following changes for clarity and to leverage Java 8 features:

### 1. Use Lambda Expressions (if applicable)

In Java 8, you can use lambda expressions for `Runnable` and `Callable` interfaces. However, since we have a custom `ParameterizedTask` class, you may not need to change the implementation if you want to keep it as a separate class. If you prefer using lambdas directly for tasks without a custom class, you can use them instead.

### 2. Optionally Use `CompletableFuture`

Java 8 introduced `CompletableFuture`, which can simplify handling asynchronous tasks and their completion. You can use `CompletableFuture` to execute tasks and handle their results without explicitly managing `Future` lists.

### Updated Example Using CompletableFuture

Hereâ€™s how you can modify your application to use `CompletableFuture` while ensuring it runs on Java 8:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class ThreadPoolService {

    private final ExecutorService executorService;

    // Constructor to initialize the thread pool with a specific size
    public ThreadPoolService(int poolSize) {
        this.executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(poolSize);
    }

    // Method to submit a task and get a CompletableFuture object
    public CompletableFuture<Void> submitTask(Runnable task) {
        return CompletableFuture.runAsync(task, executorService);
    }

    // Method to shutdown the thread pool
    public void shutdown() {
        executorService.shutdown(); // No new tasks will be accepted
    }

    // Method to wait for all tasks to complete
    public void waitForCompletion(List<CompletableFuture<Void>> futures) {
        CompletableFuture<Void> allOf = CompletableFuture.allOf(futures.toArray(new CompletableFuture[0]));
        try {
            allOf.get(); // Wait for all tasks to complete
        } catch (InterruptedException | ExecutionException e) {
            e.printStackTrace(); // Handle exceptions as needed
        }
    }
}

// Main application class
public class Application {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Initialize the thread pool service with a pool size of 4
        ThreadPoolService threadPoolService = new ThreadPoolService(4);

        // List to hold futures for task completion tracking
        List<CompletableFuture<Void>> futures = new ArrayList<>();

        // Submit ParameterizedTask instances to the thread pool and store futures
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            final int id = i;
            String taskName = "Task-" + i;
            futures.add(threadPoolService.submitTask(() -> {
                System.out.println("Executing " + taskName + " with ID " + id + " in " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
                // Simulate some work
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(1000); // Simulate work with sleep
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    Thread.currentThread().interrupt(); // Preserve interrupt status
                }
            }));
        }

        // Wait for all tasks to complete
        threadPoolService.waitForCompletion(futures);

        // Call informComplete after all tasks are finished
        informComplete();

        System.out.println("All tasks have been submitted and completed without shutting down the pool.");
    }

    // Inform method to indicate all tasks are complete
    public static void informComplete() {
        System.out.println("All tasks have been completed.");
    }
}
```

### Changes Explained

1. **Using `CompletableFuture`**: The `submitTask` method now returns a `CompletableFuture<Void>`, allowing for easier task management and completion handling.

2. **Lambda Expressions**: The `Runnable` tasks are defined using lambda expressions. This reduces boilerplate code and enhances readability.

3. **All of Completion**: The `waitForCompletion` method uses `CompletableFuture.allOf()`, which allows you to wait for all provided `CompletableFuture` instances to complete, making the code cleaner.

### Notes

- If you choose to keep your custom `ParameterizedTask` class, you can still use it in combination with `CompletableFuture`, but in the above example, I opted for simplicity by using lambdas directly.
- The overall structure remains largely the same, ensuring that it aligns with Java 8 features while still performing the required operations effectively. 

This modified implementation should work seamlessly in a Java 8 environment while leveraging some of its new features for improved readability and functionality.
